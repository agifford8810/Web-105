                As visitors survey the scenic vistas of this historic city on Casco Bay,
                gaze at boats that come and go from the waterfront, and watch the activity along the
                downtownâ€™s cobblestone streets, finding things to do may be the furthest thing
                from their minds. For those preferring to focus on filling their days with
                fun activities and enduring memories, Greater Portland delivers. Visitors will
                find family amusements, must-see attractions, day-trips, and nightlife for every

                Portland fulfills getaway, vacation, and long-term stay requirements each season of the year,
                from high-octane to low-key, indoor to outdoor, land or sea. This metropolitan city
                with small town charm is a cultural mecca and wildlife wonderland, the home of microbrews
                and sea cruises, of world-class chefs and first-class fishing, where shopping, sailing,
                or hitting the beach is at its best.

                After a career of guiding kayakers from Baja to coastal Maine, Zack Anchors is on a mission
                to connect visitors and locals alike to wonders of Casco Bay. Portland is one of the best
                places to pick-up a paddle and explore hidden harbors, civil war-era forts, and plenty
                of easy-to-reach islands. His hope is that they, like him, fall in love with kayaking
                and begin to feel a sense of ownership of the waters that hug their shoreline.
