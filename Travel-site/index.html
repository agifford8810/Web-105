            <h2>New York</h2>

            <p>
                I was born and raised in New York State. I went to college there. It is one
                of the most spectacular places in the country to live. New York is full of fun activities
                and many outdoor sports to take advantage of in any kind of weather. The mountains are
                exquisite at any time but breath taking in the fall. The fall colors fill you with joy.
                We were not too far from the capital of Albany.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the past four centuries, Albany has grown from a small Dutch settlement
                into New York State's Capital City in the heart of burgeoning Tech Valley.

                Discover downtown Albany's booming craft beverage industry, must-see attractions
                and vibrant culture. Revel in the region's rich history with world-class museums,
                historic homes and fascinating architecture. Explore beyond the city limits for scenic views
                and thrilling outdoor adventures in the Helderberg Hilltowns. Albany County is a destination
                that is beyond conventional.

                New York is also know for it's Erie Canal. The original Erie Canal,
                constructed between 1817 and 1825, connected Albany on the Hudson River,
                with Buffalo, a small emerging village at the eastern end of Lake Erie.
                Over 360 miles in length, "Clinton's Ditch," as it was known, provided the first
                continuous connection by water between the eastern and western ends of New York State,
                and prior to the advent of the railroad, the canal was the primary means of
                transporting goods across the state. Today, the Erie Canal and a network of
                connecting waterways are still in service as America's most iconic and enduring man-made waterway.
