                    <h2>Constitutional Equality Amendment</h2>
                    <p>Equality in pay, job opportunities, political structure, social security
                        and education will remain an elusive dream without a guarantee of equality
                        in the U.S. Constitution. The progress we have made — and must
                        continue to make — towards women’s equality can be lost at any time
                        because those advances depend on legislation that can be
                        (and has been) weakened or repealed by Congress. Although we did not
                        succeed in ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment, winning a
                        constitutional guarantee of equality for women remains one of NOW’s
                        top priorities.</p>

                            death for women, not mere matters of choice. NOW fully supports access to
                            safe and legal abortion, to effective birth control and emergency
                            contraception, to reproductive health services and education
                            for all women. We oppose attempts to restrict these rights

                        <p>NOW condemns the racism that inflicts a double burden of race and sex
                            discrimination on women of color. Seeing human rights as indivisible,
                            we are committed to identifying and fighting against those barriers to
                            equality and justice that are imposed by racism. A leader in the struggle
                            for civil rights since its inception in 1966, NOW is committed to
                            diversifying our movement, and we continue to fight for
                            equal opportunities for women of color in all areas including
                            employment, education and reproductive rights. NOW’s Combatting Racism
                            Committee is working to encourage growth at all
                            levels within NOW of multiracial task forces to combat racism.</p>

                        <p>NOW is committed to fighting discrimination based on sexual orientation
                            or gender identity in all areas, including employment, housing, public
                            accommodations, health services, child custody and military policies.
                            NOW is committed to educational efforts that combat the adverse effects
                            of homophobia, promote positive images in the media and ultimately
                            ensure civil rights protection for all. NOW asserts the right of
                            LGBTQIA individuals to live their lives with dignity and security,
                            and marriage equality for all.</p>

                        <p>NOW is unique in its approach to the issue of violence against women,
                            emphasizing that there are many interrelated aspects to the issue —
                            domestic violence; sexual assault; sexual harassment; violence at
                            abortion clinics; hate crimes across lines of gender, sexuality
                            and race; the gender bias in our judicial system that further
                            victimizes survivors of violence; and the violence of poverty
                            emphasized by the radical right’s attacks on poor women and children —
                            all of which result from society’s attitudes toward women
                            and efforts to “keep women in their place.”</p>
