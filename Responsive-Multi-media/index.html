                    <p>NOW is the largest, most comprehensive feminist advocacy group in the United States.
                        Our purpose is to TAKE ACTION to bring women into full particpation in society –
                        sharing equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities with men,
                        while living free from discrimination.</p>

                    <p>llinois NOW is an organization of chapters from every area in Illinois. Our
                        organization sets its agenda at the state conference and meets every
                        month alternating between the the State Council (made up of chapter
                        representatives and officers) and executive committee
                        (officers and task force chairs) to monitor progress, make changes,
                        and ensure that the organization runs smoothly. Our organization’s priorities
                        are driven by its chapters and members. Our meetings are open to all NOW member
                        and are closed only by a vote of those members. As an integral part of the
                        National Organization for Women, Illinois NOW joins over 500,000 contributing
                        members and 500 chapters in all 50 states and the District of
                        Columbia in the struggle for women’s rights.

                    <p>NOW is the largest, most comprehensive feminist advocacy group in the
                        United States and one of the few multi-issue progressive grassroots organizations
                        that has existed since its founding in 1966. NOW stands against all oppression,
                        recognizing that racism, sexism, and classism are interrelated, that other forms of
                        oppression such as homophobia and ableism work together with these three to keep power
                        and privilege concentrated in the hands of a few. Both the actions NOW takes and its
                        position on the issues are principled, uncompromising and often ahead of their time.
                        NOW is a leader, not a follower, of public opinion.
