<h1>White fragility is real. But ‘White Fragility’ is flawed</h1>
<h2>Opening</h2>
<p><q>Race relations are profoundly complex,</q> Robin DiAngelo writes in “White Fragility,” a book that,
     two years after a best-selling debut, is having a new burst of popularity and urgency.
      In the midst of a nationwide debate on institutional racism and police violence, 
      Americans are binge-reading (or at least bulk-buying) recent texts on race to help them grapple
       with that complexity.  DiAngelo’s “White Fragility” — the No. 1 bestseller on the New York Times
        nonfiction list this week, and The Post’s No. 4 — is officially now part of a new canon.</p>

<h2>More</h2>
<p>Except it doesn’t deserve that distinction. Even as it introduces a memorable concept,
    “White Fragility” presents oversimplified arguments that are self-fulfilling, even self-serving.
    The book flattens people of any ancestry into two-dimensional beings fitting predetermined narratives.
     And reading DiAngelo offers little insight into how a national reckoning such as the one we’re 
     experiencing today could have come about. In a “White Fragility” world, nothing ever changes, 
     because change would violate its premise.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>The killing of George Floyd and the widespread protests that followed have 
    brought into the open, yet again, the systems of racism embedded in powerful 
    Americans institutions such as law enforcement. Reimagining those institutions so they earn the 
    trust of all Americans is the work of today but also of generations to come, an arduous and 
    complicated effort. In DiAngelo’s telling, however, race relations in America are actually 
    not “profoundly complex,” as she initially puts it, but simple and binary.</p>

<h2>Tough Critic</h2>
<p>In her training workshops, DiAngelo witnesses white fragility at work. 
    She finds it in the white schoolteacher who, after imitating the speech pattern of a black parent, 
    recoils when DiAngelo asks her to tell the story differently. In the Italian American who argues that 
    white people experience racism too, because his own ancestors suffered discrimination. In the white woman 
    who contends that because she grew up in a country with few black people, she had not developed racist 
    feelings; when DiAngelo challenges that <b>self-image</b>, the woman is angered and vows to never participate 
    in such programs again. These episodes occur because “the smallest amount of racial 
    stress is intolerable,” the author explains.</p>

<h3>My Take</h3>
 <p> After the death of George Floyd, I, like many others, began looking at what I could do to make a 
     difference.  I bought this book.  The beginning is a hard read and one would need a Kindle to be able 
    search some of the verbiage she uses but by and large, it is insightful. Troubling but insightful.</p>
